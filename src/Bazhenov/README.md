# Problems solved by Artyom Bazhenov

## Task 1

This program displays a colorful cube on a dark blue background.

You can do the following things:

* Rotate the cube &ndash; drag the mouse cursor across the screen with the `LMB` pressed.
* Change the cube's colors &ndash; press `Space`, select a color, and see what happens!

## Task 2

This program displays a colorful solid on a dark blue background. 
The solid morphs back and forth between a cube and a sphere.

The controls are the same as in [Task 1](#task-1).

## Task 3

This program displays several illuminated cubes.

You can do the following things:
* Toggle morphing by pressing `M`
* Toggle the light source's orbiting around the scene by pressing `O`
* Set up the Gouraud model with `G`
* Set up the Phong model with `P`
* Change the color of the cubes by pressing `Space` and selecting a color

## Task 4

This program displays a cube with ancient glyphs carved upon it.

The controls are the same as in [Task 3](#task-3), 
except you cannot change the color of the cube.

You can see the difference between the disabled normal mapping (for the Gouraud model)
and the enabled normal mapping (for the Phong model).

## Task 5

This program renders a scene. The scene contains three differently oriented checkered planes
and four spheres of different color and reflectivity. The rendering results in saving
an image titled `result.png`.
